# ob-dotfiles — quick setup

This repository contains a small setup script (`setup.sh`) that installs and configures Openbox, Polybar, Rofi, a Gruvbox theme, Font Awesome, and the Bibata cursor (user-local) on Debian-based systems.

## What `setup.sh` does
- Installs packages commonly needed for this Openbox setup (Debian/Ubuntu packages).
- Unpacks the bundled Gruvbox GTK/Openbox theme into `~/.local/share/themes`.
- Installs Font Awesome to `~/.fonts` and refreshes font cache.
- Writes Polybar config to `~/.config/polybar/config.ini` and copies the provided `launch.sh`.
- Creates Rofi helper scripts: `~/.config/rofi/powermenu.sh` and `~/.config/rofi/launcher.sh`.
- Writes GTK configuration files for GTK2/3/4 so apps pick up the Gruvbox theme and `Papirus-Dark` icon theme.
- Downloads Bibata cursor `Bibata-Modern-Classic` (v2.0.7) into `~/.icons`, sets `~/.icons/default/index.theme`, and persists `XCURSOR_THEME` in `~/.profile`.

Note: the script is intended for Debian-based systems and uses `apt`.

## Run the script
Make the script executable (optional) and run it as your user:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
# or
bash setup.sh
```

The script includes `sudo` where package installation is required.

## Apply changes (logout/login)
Some settings (especially cursor theme and GTK2 apps) require logging out and back in to take effect. Steps:

- Log out and log back in to your desktop session.
- Or restart your display/session manager.

If you want to apply the cursor setting for the current shell session without logging out, source your profile:

```bash
source ~/.profile
```

## Quick tests / useful commands
- Reload Polybar (preferred):

```bash
polybar-msg cmd restart
```

- Restart Polybar manually if above fails:

```bash
killall -q polybar
polybar -r & disown
```

- Test Rofi scripts manually:

```bash
~/.config/rofi/launcher.sh    # should open application launcher
~/.config/rofi/powermenu.sh   # should show power menu
```

- Check cursor/theme values:

```bash
echo $XCURSOR_THEME
cat ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
cat ~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini
cat ~/.gtkrc-2.0
```

## Notes & troubleshooting
- If the Font Awesome icons appear as boxes, run `fc-cache -f -v` and ensure the fonts were copied to `~/.fonts`.
- If a cursor or theme change doesn't appear, log out/in — some compositors require a full session restart.
- The script installs the Bibata cursors into `~/.icons` (user-local). If you prefer system-wide installation (to `/usr/share/icons`), edit the script to copy there (requires `sudo`).
- The script writes GTK config files directly and does not rely on `gsettings`.

## Want changes?
If you want system-wide cursor install, different icon theme, or to remove a particular package from the installer list, tell me and I can update `setup.sh`.
